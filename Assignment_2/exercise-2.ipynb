    "In this exercise, we get to have a first hands-on experience with neural network training. Many frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow, Caffe) allow easy usage of deep neural networks without precise knowledge of the inner workings of backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms. While these are very useful tools, it is important to get a good understanding of how to implement basic network training from scratch before using these libraries to speed up the process. For this purpose, we will implement a simple two-layer neural network and its training algorithm based on back-propagation using only basic matrix operations in questions 1 to 3. In question 4, we will use a popular deep learning library, PyTorch, to do the same and understand the advantages offered by using such tools.\n",
